This repository contains gitian signatures for Civitas.
It should be updated on each release.

## How to Make and Submit Gitian Sigs

See the release process in the Civitas Core repository on how to build the
release archives to create gitian sigs. This can be found in
`doc/release-process.md`. Be sure to use the release process of **the tag that
you're building**, so for example https://github.com/eastcoastcrypto/Civitas/blob/v1.0.0/doc/release-process.md for
`v0.0.1`.

[Instructions for setting up a gitian build environment](https://github.com/eastcoastcrypto/Civitas/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)
can also be found there.
